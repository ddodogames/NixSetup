# NixSetup
Config file of my NixOS setup for my old laptop. Nothing fancy about it.

## What does it include?
Nothing much but here it is anyways:
| **General**         | **Uses**                       |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Desktop Environment**     | Xfce (X11)                  |
| **Keyboard Input thingy**   | ibus with uniemoji engine   |
| **Kernel**     | Latest (normal one)                      |
| **File manager**     | Thunar with some plugins           |
